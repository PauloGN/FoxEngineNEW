 In C++ and DirectX, the pixel shader is responsible for determining the color
 of each pixel in the graphics pipeline. It achieves this by applying calculations
 and operations, including color tinting, to produce the final color output for each pixel.
 The pixel shader is an essential component for achieving various visual effects and
 controlling the appearance of rendered images or scenes.
